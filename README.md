A multi-threaded dinosaur game implemented for the **CS3423 Operating Systems** course, running on the **EdSim51** 8051 microcontroller simulator using the **SDCC** compiler.  
The game is controlled by a keypad and displayed on an LCD, with core logic designed to operate under strict memory constraints.
